Team:<br>


> All in Rust<br>


## Current Limitations and Considerations

- It has not been verified as a flight-ready or launch-certified system. As stated in the inital README:
  - This bundle has not been fully verified as an operational system<br>

- The current functionality does not cover all subsystems required for a complete 🚀rocket launch stack:
  - Propulsion and thrust vector control
  - Ground communication and telemetry links
  - Redundancy and fault-tolerant mechanisms
  - Real-time safety monitoring and abort logic
